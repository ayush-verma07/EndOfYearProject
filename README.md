# EndOfYearProject
This is our group's end of the year project... ScholastIQ!

In order to access all of the files correctly, you need to follow the steps on this README very carefully, otherwise the CSS and JS won't load in correctly. It's important that you end up opening the application on http://localhost:8080/ and not as a file. 

Follow the directions on a personal device (school computers may bring up issues (e.g. can't open local host or cmd) so personal ones are best). 

1. Download the entire "studentapp" folder I have added on the home page of this repository.
2. Open up the folder (warning it may come as a .zip so just extract all files) in VS Code (or another preferable IDE)
3. Run the StudentappApplication.java file
4. Open up http://localhost:8080/ on Google (other broswers may create issue)
5. If you end up editing these files you have two options: 1) Commit the changes using git on cmd if you understand the process; 2) upload updated code to Google Drive and let us know of the changes you made in #general or #code-help in the Discord server.

In order to successfully run changes you made to the code on localhost, you have to follow these steps:
1. Compile the code by running './mvnw package' in the terminal.
2. Run the compiled code with '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java @/var/folders/9k/wsmzrnrj09x4cm8r2ctkc7v40000gp/T/cp_9yv0b519l17crmlra646ert2z.argfile fhs.project.studentapp.StudentappApplication' in your terminal.
These terminal prompts can also be found in the HELP.md file.
